# Lesson - Get Started with Python

* Python is a modern [`scripting language`](#glossary) that lets people write games, websites, messaging apps, or even lets you crunch numbers for statistics calculations!
* Python has a [`print function`](#glossary) which can display [`input`](#glossary) in a [`terminal`](#glossary).
* Try it out now in our cool terminal, which you can see on the right of this screen. Click the `Run` button to the right and see what happens!
* Now, try clicking the 'Save' button. This lets you save what you've written in the `Your code:` box. You can even leave our website, come back later, and your saved work will still be here!
* The `Visualize` button is a fun tool we have that lets you see what your code does when it runs. You can test it now, but you won't see much, since our first program is pretty simple. Trust that as you progress through our course and as your code gets more complex, the `Visualize` button will show yor more than it does now!
* The `Test` button lets you see if what you've written is correct. We've got special tools that test to see if you've solved our challenge. 

# Challenge - Try the Test Button!
All you have to do to pass this first level is press the `Test` button. Try it now!
(If the `Test` button is grey and unclickable, try clicking the `Run` button first. You'll need to `Run` before you `Test` on every exercise!)

You should memorize all these words. These are import key words for programmers.

**Input** - Information that's sent to a computer or a computer program for processing. In the top box that you see on the right, the words "Hello, world!" are the `input`.

**Print function** - A python tool that lets users display inputs to the terminal.

**Scripting language** - A set of commands that are interpreted by a computer to achieve a set of tasks.

**Terminal** - A special device or window that lets users send commands to a computer and receive output from a computer. In our example to the right, the two grey boxes on the right are both terminals.
