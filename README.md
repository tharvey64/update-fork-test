# String Scramblin

# Exercise

* Write a function that will take two arguments. Both of which will be strings. 
* The function will check both strings and see which characters are in both strings
* The function will return a list containing all the letters found in both strings

***HINT***

* You can create an empty list and assign it to a variable. 
* Then use the [`append()`](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_append.htm) method to add values to that list
