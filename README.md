# The Fibonacci Sequence

* This exercise is another common programming brain teaser
* The fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers where each is the sum of the previous two. 
* Take a look at the example below

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...and so on
```
* You can also read more about it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)  

# Exercise

* Write a function that will take in a number
* The function should print the fibonacci sequence up to, but not including, that number.
* Each number should be printed on a new line.
